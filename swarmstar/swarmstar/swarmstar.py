"""
If your using swarmstar, this is the only file you need to import and interact with.

First of all, make sure to have your .env file set up. You can use the .env.example file as a template.
Then, simply instantiate the Swarmstar class with an id and goal. This will create a new swarmstar space in MongoDB and the first operation.
Following that, just keep feeding operations into the execute function and it will return the next operations to be executed.

Keep in mind that you shouldn't pass UserCommunication operations into the execute function. 
I've provided a template for how you may handle those in the user_communication_examples folder.
